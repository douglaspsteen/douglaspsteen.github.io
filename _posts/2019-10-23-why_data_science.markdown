> “True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.” -Mark Manson

I was attracted to geology as a career because it seemed to check all the boxes. The outdoors, opportunities to see exotic places, the chance to help unravel the mysteries of our planet – these are the things that brought me to geology in college. The coursework was all very interesting, and I wouldn’t trade the amazing field trips taken with my fellow majors, many of whom became close friends. 

I enjoyed my undergraduate geology career enough to go on for a master’s degree. I got to work on an exciting interdisciplinary project studying the past magnetic variability of earth’s magnetic field and its climate, using a 20,000-year-old sediment record from an arctic lake. I even got to travel to a remote corner of Alaska for field work. The sun didn’t set for three weeks, and one day we found ourselves in the middle of a full caribou migration.

It may sound strange, but looking back, I don’t think I ever gave enough thought to my eventual career after finishing those six years of school. I was always so absorbed in writing a thesis chapter, analyzing data sets, or studying for that next exam. After graduating and moving to Dallas with my wife, I ended up working as a geologist at an environmental consulting firm. I was thrilled to have found a great job in my field, without having to relocate. As with any job, there were parts of this one that I enjoyed, and parts that I did not. The good: I liked being able to work with data and run statistical analyses to make recommendations for our clients. The not-so-good: fast forward 2.5 years, and the combination of field and office work had begun to take its toll. I couldn’t help but think how straining the nature of this work would my wife and I wanted to start our family – leaving town for field work with minimal notice just wouldn’t be an option in the future. Ironically, the geology field work that I had found liberating as a student had become a burden as a professional – especially in the Texas summer heat. Once I also realized that I was not looking forward to advancing into positions of higher responsibility in this specific industry, I finally knew it was time for a change.

As I brainstormed ways to transition my skill set to a more suitable career, I couldn’t help thinking back to my favorite college course – Earth and Environmental Data Analysis. The title doesn’t give it away, but the class consisted entirely of programming in R. I marveled at our ability to run multiple linear regression, principal component analysis, and other techniques in R that would have been difficult, cumbersome, or downright impossible in Excel. It was here that I first tasted the satisfaction of producing an error-free code after hours of effort. After the semester ended, I had to shift my focus to my thesis and didn’t find my way back to coding for several more years.

With all that I’ve experienced in the past few years, I’m now ready to take my next step. As the quote above so succinctly conveys, we will never fully eliminate problems from our personal or working lives. I think the trick is to find the problems that we enjoy solving and take on as many as we can handle. I’m learning that I enjoy helping people solve problems and answer questions while wading knee-deep through data. I couldn’t be more excited to make my way through the challenges that await in the Flatiron data science bootcamp.
